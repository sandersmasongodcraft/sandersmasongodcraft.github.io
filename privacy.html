<p>God Mod Craft's PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p>Last updated: June 20th, 2020</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This entry was written in English (UK). To the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.</p>
<p>For our company your privacy is a top priority. We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with your information and we do not take this lightly. Our company respect the privacy of our customers, and take our duty to protect your information very seriously.</p>
<p>We do not compromise with your privacy. We design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind. We involve experts from various fields, including legal, security and others to make sure that no decision is taken without respect for your privacy.</p>
<p>We strive to be transparent in the way we process your data. Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we have written our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language. We actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy practices!</p>
<p>We work hard to keep your information secure. We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We constantly update our security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.</p>
<p><br />1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Welcome to God Mod Craft's Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking time to read it!</p>
<p>We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.</p>
<p><br />2. WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to God Mod Craft's website and app. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our "services" or "app" in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
<p>How We Collect and Make Use of Your Information Our app does not share or store any kind of personal information collected from the user account anywhere but on the device on which the app is installed and when signed into the online control panel. By using this app, you consent to this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Our product does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.<br />Link to privacy policy of third party service providers used by our products:<br />- https://www.applovin.com/privacy/<br />- https://policies.google.com/privacy<br />- https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy<br />It goes without saying, we can't help you have an awesome user experience without some information about you, such as your email address in some of our services. We also collect information generated as you use our services. Your information may be kept in an identifiable format, or in an aggregate format which means that you cannot reasonably be identified from it.</p>
<p>To use certain features in our services, you may allow us to access your camera or the photo gallery. Depending on your device, Apple system will ask for your permission before allowing us to access these features.</p>
<p>Features that allow you to share content about your use of our services with your connections or through your social network.</p>
<p>We may also collect your information when you use our app such as when you post or share material, upload data, request further services or make selections using our app, if such functionality is available in the app.</p>
<p>If you contact our support team, we collect the information you give us when you report a problem, contact or communicate with us.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may request your opinions, suggestions, or modification and improvement ideas ("Feedback") through surveys, or other similar requests. Any responses you provide are voluntary, however you agree that any Feedback you provide shall be owned by us and may be used by our company in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>4. HOW WE USE INFORMATION</p>
<p>The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services. Additionally, we may use your information to help keep you safe and to communicate with you. Read on for a more detailed explanation of the various reasons we use your information, together with practical examples.</p>
<p>To improve our services and develop new ones:</p>
<p>Develop new features and services (for example, we may decide to build a new feature further to requests or feedback received from users).<br />God Mod Craft uses the Google Analytics tool Firebase in order to carry out analysis on information which is gathered by our app. Device information and other information which we gather are provided to Google in order to enable them to carry out data analysis. Any information which is provided to Google will become subject to Google's privacy policy which is located here: www.google.com/privacy.html. For further information on how Google's Firebase analytics tool uses data, please see the site "How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps", (located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).<br />Conduct research and analysis of your behavior about your use of, or interest in, our products, services, or content to improve our services and content (for instance, we may decide to change the look and feel or even substantially modify a given feature based on users' behavior). This software may record information such as how often you use the services, what happens within the services, aggregated usage, performance data, app errors and debugging information, and where the apps were downloaded from.</p>
<p>To communicate with you</p>
<p>Communicate with you by postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices (including through in-application advertising) about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us, our parent or subsidiary companies or other third parties. If you do not wish to receive in-application advertising, in some cases you can upgrade to the paid version of the app.<br />When you share your information with us via a social network provider like Facebook, we use this to show information on your social network profile (subject to your privacy setting and preferences for such social network) and to allow you to share information about our services with your connections or on your social network profile.<br />With your consent (where needed), to send you email marketing in order to provide you with information about services that you may find of interest. You can opt-out of receiving direct marketing communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions included in our marketing communications. We also send you non-marketing emails or messages, such as those related to transactions, your account, security, or product changes. Examples of service-related messages include an email address confirmation/welcome email when you register your account, service availability or modification of key features or functions.</p>
<p><br />5. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>Since our goal is to provide the best services we can to you, the main sharing of users' information is with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other IAC Group companies and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your information is shared with others.</p>
<p>With our service providers and partners</p>
<p>We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner. We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services. These third parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, marketing, advertising and security operations. These service providers may have limited access to your information, which is needed to perform their functions, but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. For example, we use your non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information) for targeted online marketing through tools like Facebook Custom Audience to contact interested parties.<br />In addition, we may share aggregated information we collect, under any of the above circumstances, with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis or other legitimate business purposes. Please note that such aggregated information will not include any information which allows third parties to identity you.</p>
<p><br />6. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and after it is received. We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.</p>
<p>We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately in our support.</p>
<p><br />7. YOUR RIGHTS</p>
<p>We want you to be in control of your information and be aware of your privacy rights, so here are a few key points to remember:</p>
<p>Depending on your location you may have some or all of the following rights in relation to how we use your personal information:<br />&bull; Access: you may request access to your personal information and receive copies of it;<br />&bull; Correction: you may have inaccurate/incomplete personal information corrected and updated;<br />&bull; Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data: you can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal information or to limit our use of it.<br />&bull; Deletion: in certain circumstances, you can request a right "to be forgotten" (this is a right to have your information deleted or our use of your data restricted). We will honour such requests unless we have to retain this information to comply with a legal obligation or unless we have an overriding interest to retain it.<br />&bull; Portability: in certain circumstances, exercise the right to data portability (this is a right to obtain a transferable version of your personal information to transfer to another provider)<br />&bull; Consent Management: where we rely on consent to process your personal data, you may withdraw consent at any time. You do not have to provide a reason for your withdrawal where processing is based on consent.<br />If you wish to exercise any of these rights, or wish to object to our use of your information, please write to us at the address listed below and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.<br />Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on the rights and freedoms of another person. For example, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore.<br />For your protection, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.</p>
<p><br />8. CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS</p>
<p>Sharing of information sometimes involves cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United States of America and other jurisdictions. The United States, European Economic Area ("EEA") Member States, and other countries all have different laws. When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal information in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live.</p>
<p>The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses (also known as Model Clauses), which provide safeguards for personal information that is transferred outside of the EEA. We use these Model Clauses or other suitable safeguards (such as EU-US Privacy Shield to send personal information to some of our third party service providers in the United States, where they are certified to receive such information under the Privacy Shield Program) to permit data transfers from the EEA to other countries.</p>
<p><br />9. HOW LONG WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>We retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this policy, for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the services to you. We will also retain and use your information to the extent necessary:</p>
<p>to comply with applicable law;<br />to evidence our compliance with applicable law;<br />if there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or<br />if the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as enforcing our terms or fraud prevention. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for security incidents from opening a new account.<br />Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical constraints.</p>
<p><br />12. PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</p>
<p>Because we're always looking for new and innovative ways to help you enjoy our services, this policy may change over time. We will notify you of any material changes so that you have time to review the changes.</p>
<p><br />13. DATA PROTECTION OFFICER</p>
<p>For our European users, our Data Protection Officer is responsible for ensuring your rights are respected and to review and oversee how we collect and use your personal information.</p>
